Tailgating
==========

Tailgating Project by EA

This project will develop a system that enables merchants to issue loyalty cards to their customers and carry out business 
transactions using these loyalty cards. Customers will be able to shop with the loyalty card or pass it on to someone else 
to use with the same merchant. The system provides a convenient way to do financial transactions at tailgating events. 
Merchants will interact with the system to credit, debit, update, provide transaction history, or establish new cards.
